This repository contains a simple C++ implementation of a cellular genetic
algorithm. The algorithm uses MPI for interprocess communication.

The MPI version has been tested on the OneMax problem. A more complicated
implementation of training an artificial neural network for digit
classification has been implemented as well (without MPI).
